# Theia - Progress Monitor Extension

Contributes an progress monitor widget to Theia that allows users to show status of long running processes.
This status can come from either the backend i.e. language servers or from the front end.

See [here](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia) for a detailed documentation on Theia.
